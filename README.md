# Take-Home Assignment

## Data: Balance Zone France

You can find both relevant files in the "Take-Home" Folder in this repo:

- **Power Generation by Type**
- **Commercial Flows of Electricity**

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to learn something about power generation and flows in France and get a feeling for working with time series data via **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

Using Python and your favourite plotting package, create a handful of visualisations or summary statistics to present in the final meeting. Focus on two aspects:

- Generation by type
- Day-ahead commercial flows *(ignore total flows)*

We are interested in your approach to handling and cleaning the data, so bring your code in a presentable format to explain your work steps (e.g. Jupyter Notebook).

## Hints

- The commercial flows file contains information about:

	- Day-ahead commercial flows
	- Total flows
	- Day-ahead and total export and import positions

For this exercise, **only the “Day Ahead - Value (MW)” for each MTU (Market Time Unit) is relevant**.

# Live Coding Assignment

If there is time after the discussion of your results, we will be doing a simple live-coding exercise about hydropower dispatch.

**Data:**

- 1 week of assumed “perfect forecasts” for French day-ahead spot prices

**Instructions:**

- We will have an interactive discussion in person

**Note:**
The goal of this exercise is to have an interactive, constructive, fun discussion about the topic at hand. It is not a live coding job interview like you would see for a full-time position, so please feel free to ask questions, share your reasoning, and enjoy the process!
