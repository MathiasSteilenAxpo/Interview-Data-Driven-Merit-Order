# Take-Home Assignment

## Data: Balance Zone France

You can find both relevant files in the "Take-Home" Folder in this repo:

- **Generation by Type**
- **Commercial Flows**

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to learn something about power generation and flows in France via **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

Using Python and your favourite plotting package, create a handful of visualisations or summary statistics to present in the final meeting. Focus on:

- Generation by type
- Day-ahead commercial flows *(ignore total flows)*

We interested in your approach to handling and cleaning the data, so bring your code in a presentable format to explain your work steps (e.g. Jupyter Notebook).

## Hints

- The commercial flows file contains information about:

	- Day-ahead commercial flows
	- Total flows
	- Day-ahead and total export and import positions

For this exercise, **only the “Day Ahead - Value (MW)” for each MTU (Market Time Unit) is relevant**.

This file represents the reality of working with poorly structured data quite well. Before you can dive into analysis, you need to extract only the data from the table which is relevant to the analysis.

# Live Coding Assignment

If there is time after the discussion of your results, there will be a simple live-coding exercise about hydropower dispatch.

**Data:**

- 1 week of assumed “perfect forecasts” for French day-ahead spot prices

**Instructions:**

- We will have an interactive discussion in person

**Note:**
The goal of this exercise is to have an interactive, constructive, fun discussion about the topic at hand. It is not a live coding job interview like you would see for a full-time position, so please feel free to ask questions, share your reasoning, and enjoy the process!
